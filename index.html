                            <p>As you may know, we hosted the lychee fundraiser not only to raise funds for the club but also to help people who wanted to buy Arduinos fund their purchase. The little infographic I made above explained how the process worked and how it helped us save money. 
                                <br><br>
                                Anyway, tax included, the Arduino Uno Rev3 came to about $24. Our awesome treasurer, Stella Saw, collected money for the lychee, but not the Arduino, so if you planned to buy one, you messaged Stella on Facebook to let her know that you were interested in being part of the group order, and she told you how much money to bring to the meeting on Thursday, April 19.</p>

                            Students poured into the classroom as the officers set up the presentation, music and sign-in station for the first meeting. With a packed room of at least 80 people, the officers introduced themselves, announced plans for the upcoming year and gave away free snacks. Afterwards, they hosted a coding-themed Kahoot to start off the year!

                            Four officers, Patrick Liu, Sandra Tang, Stella Saw and Samuel Berkun, volunteered at Field Elementary School's Science Night in Pasadena. They taught kids how to code through Hour of Code, Scratch, and HTML. Students also experienced playing Minecraft with a keyboard and monitor hooked up to a Raspberry Pi. Other organizations at the event include Cal Tech, JPL, Pasadena Audubon Society and USC.
